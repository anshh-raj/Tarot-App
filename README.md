# TarotAura App: Setup Guide

## Requirements
1. **Android Studio** (latest version recommended)
2. **Internet connection** for API calls

## Steps to Setup the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anshh-raj/Tarot-App.git
cd Tarot-App
```

### 2. Open the Project in Android Studio
- Launch **Android Studio**.
- Select **Open an existing project** and navigate to the cloned directory.
- Click **OK** to open the project.

### 3. Sync Gradle
Once the project is open, Android Studio will prompt you to sync Gradle. Click **Sync Now** to download the required dependencies.

### 4. Run the App
- Connect your Android device or launch an **Android Emulator**.
- Click the **Run** button in Android Studio or press **Shift + F10** to run the app on your device/emulator.

### 5. Troubleshooting (API Loading Issues)
If the app doesn't display tarot cards immediately, there may be a temporary issue with the API. If this happens:
1. **Close and reopen the app**.
2. **Re-run the code** to attempt loading again.

The issue is usually related to network latency or API availability and should be resolved upon retrying.
